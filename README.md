# Rhyme

## What is this?

This is a Homebrew formula for `rhyme`, a command-line program that takes a word and returns a formatted list of all words that rhyme with the input word.

See http://rhyme.sourceforge.net for more information.

To install with Homebrew, please:

`$ brew tap shaunplee/rhyme`

and then run:

`$ brew install rhyme`
